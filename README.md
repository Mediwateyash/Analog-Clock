# Analog-Clock
This project is a simple implementation of an analog clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays a functional clock with hour, minute, and second hands, updating in real-time. The clock features a clean and minimalist design and is fully responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes.
